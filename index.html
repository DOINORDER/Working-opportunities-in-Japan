        I have had close relationships with the Japanese managers assigned to me and with those to whom I reported in
        Japan. I have seen how they manage their own people, American employees, customers and vendors, and the external
        marketplace. I’ve heard the president of Toshiba America say, as we discussed some problems with product
        quality, “This is not Japanese quality.” And I’ve heard Japanese managers say, when talking about problems with
        an American employee, “We must help this person overcome his weaknesses.”
      </p>
      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The Japanese don’t like businesses that aren’t profitable, so when they talk
        about investing in market share, they’re not talking about negative P&L. They want the business to make a
        “healthy” profit, which means enough money so you can still break even if you have a setback. But it’s okay to
        make a few percentage points less and spend money on promotions and other things that will build market
        share—things that look like an expense but translate into an investment.

      <p class="sectionTag text-big">Japanese food and cuisine.</p>
      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
        Japanese cuisine encompasses the regional and traditional foods of Japan, which have developed through centuries
        of political, economic, and social changes. The traditional cuisine of Japan (Japanese: washoku) is based on
        rice with miso soup and other dishes; there is an emphasis on seasonal ingredients. Side dishes often consist of
        fish, pickled vegetables, and vegetables cooked in broth. Seafood is common, often grilled, but also served raw
        as sashimi or in sushi. Seafood and vegetables are also deep-fried in a light batter, as tempura. Apart from
        rice, a staple includes noodles, such as soba and udon. Japan also has many simmered dishes, such as fish
        products in broth called oden, or beef in sukiyaki and nikujaga.
      </p>
      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
        Historically influenced by Chinese cuisine, Japanese cuisine has also opened up to influence from Western
        cuisines in the modern era. Dishes inspired by foreign food—in particular Chinese food—like ramen and gyōza, as
        well as foods like spaghetti, curry and hamburgers, have been adapted to Japanese tastes and ingredients.
        Traditionally, the Japanese shunned meat as a result of adherence to Buddhism, but with the modernization of
        Japan in the 1880s, meat-based dishes such as tonkatsu and yakiniku have become common. Since this time,
        Japanese cuisine, particularly sushi and ramen, has become popular globally.

      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
        Japanese culture is a set of values that puts importance on social harmony and hard work. Up until the 10th
        century, Japanese culture was similar to the Chinese culture, but the rise of the samurai in the Heian Period
        and the isolation during the Edo Period changed the rules of society. Overall, the culture was influenced by the
        local Shinto religion, Buddhism, Confucianism and the limited natural resources.
      </p>
      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
        While Japanese lifestyle has been Westernized recently, Japanese people still do everything possible to preserve
        their rich cultural heritage by practicing tea ceremony, wearing kimono and studying traditional arts and crafts
        from early childhood.

      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
        The Japanese really pride themselves on their cleanliness, and upon first arrival in the country you may be
        surprised by how sparkling clean the streets are. Hotels and restaurants tend to be absolutely spotless, filled
        with pleasant smells, and regularly and efficiently cleaned. One downside is that there tends to be a total
        absence of trash cans in public spaces. However, you can just follow the Japanese example and carry garbage with
        you until you find a place to get rid of it later on.

      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
        Japan boasts a total of 21 World Heritage Sites, including 17 cultural monuments and 4 natural landscapes, and
        there are currently 8 more sites pending UNESCO classification. There are number of stunning historic temples
        and shrines in almost every town and city in Japan, while larger cultural centers can have up to 1,000 temples
        within their municipality.
